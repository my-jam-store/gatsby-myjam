A marketplace for exotic grocery.

The project is open source and built on the JAM Stack using the following technologies:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting.
- [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) for products.
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for images.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for cart and checkout.
- [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) for search.
